## Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Backend Software Engineering
[Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Backend Software Engineering](https://github.com/kimaniwalker/Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise/files/8376309/Fetchpdf.pdf)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all node_modules by running
`npm install` or `yarn install`

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Background
Fetch users have points in their accounts. Users only see a single balance in their accounts. But for reporting purposes Fetch actually tracks their
points per payer/partner. In Fetch's system, each transaction record contains: payer (string), points (integer), timestamp (date).
For earning points it is easy to assign a payer, we know which actions earned the points. And thus which partner should be paying for the points.
When a user spends points, they don't know or care which payer the points come from. But, Fetch's accounting team does care how the points are
spent. There are two rules for determining what points to "spend" first:
- Fetch wants the oldest points to be spent first (oldest based on transaction timestamp, not the order theyâ€™re received)
- Fetch wants no payer's points to go negative.

## Backend Requirements

- Add transactions for a specific payer and date. </br>
  Functionality is located in the [addNew.js](pages/api/transactions/addNew.js) file

- Spend points using the rules above and return a list of { "payer": <string>, "points": <integer> } for each call. </br>
  Functionality is located in the [spendPoints.js](pages/api/transactions/spendPoints.js) file. Once request has completed , and response is received all records are updated to reflect the new existing balance
  
- Return all payer point balances. </br>
  All payer point balances are calculated using the JS reduce method. Balance is reflected on home page.
  
## How It Works
- Click A store to add some rewards points. For the sake of time and simplicity , each click makes a backend call adding 1000 rewards points to the users balance. It passes in a store name depending on the store that is clicked. This data is passed to the backend where it creates a new record with a timestamp. Once the request has been completed the data is stored into local storage. If the store name exist already , it adds the points to that existing store.
- Once you have rewards points to spend , you can do so by clicking on a item. For simplicity sake , there is a 200 point , 500 point , and 1000 point option. Once clicked , it makes a call to the backend where it sorts through all of the rewards transactions and uses the points with the oldest timestamp first. 
  
## Additional Features  
  
- Local storage to persist rewards data
- Sum up all rewards with same `payer` name
- Users cannot spend rewards points that they do not have
